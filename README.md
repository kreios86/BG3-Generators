<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

This is literally the first iteration of a tool a few people have asked me for. Its -shite-!
Here's why:
* Its like... 30 lines of actual code?
* Its not optimized what so over... heh optimized.
* All it does right now is generate either UUIDs or Handles for BG3 localizations.

One day I might turn it into a full fledged, GUI available, tool for modders to use. One day, maybe.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

Jacked some "how to" from a read me template, if it works it works. If not ask me.

Banana. Install NPM packages
